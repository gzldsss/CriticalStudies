# Something about Literacy

Literacy is an ability to read and write. Actually, we need to read and write all the time in our lives, we read and understand the meaning of words, and express our ideas by writing. Each of us should have this ability, which is essential for us to learn and work in this society, that's why we have been working on our literacy skills since primary school.
To call computer programming a literacy means that it is a fundamental skill, which is very essential for effective communication and problem-solving in the modern world, much like reading and writing. We can read codes to understand its meaning, and we can also express our own ideas by writing a string of codes, let the computer work according to our wishes, or let others understand the meaning of our codes. This means that we need more people to understand programming and to learn it. And the popularization of programming literacy will allow all walks of life to have faster efficiency and will promote the development of the entire society.

The article and video advocate that everyone of us should learn code, which I think is very interesting, because before that we had different ideas. I thought that only programmers need to learn code, but now I am starting to think that programmers are not the only ones who can learn to code that we can use code as a tool to make our work easier or make us to be good people.
Just like we can learn to paint without being a painter, or learn mathematics without being a mathematician, we can regard programming as a part of our life, or a common skill. Just like we learned mathematics from an early age, learned linear algebra and solid geometry and a lot of difficult knowledge, but now most of us can only use addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
In my opinion, as automation continues to increase across industries, understanding how to code will become increasingly important. Knowing how to write scripts and automate tasks can save time and increase efficiency. As the book says: “The ubiquity of computation means that programming is emerging from the exclusive domain of computer science and penetrating professions such as journalism, biology, design— and, through library databases and the digital humanities, even the study of literature and history”, computers now cover all walks of life, just like when we want to visit a hospital, we can first make an appointment on the internet, and when we want to visit a museum, we can first buy tickets from the official website. This makes social life convenient and has a faster speed with, this time, coding literacy is extremely important.
And the demand for skilled programmers is growing, and learning to code can open up career opportunities in a variety of fields, including tech, finance, and healthcare.
For example, just like in the arts, when a painter can program, or even when a musician can program, they will be able to make more integrated, more novel works, and they will be able to combine their artworks with programming to produce more unexpected results.
But I think it is unrealistic for everyone to learn to code. In China, there are remote areas where they do not have access to formal education or even a computer. Exposing them to programming is a very difficult thing to do. With the huge imbalance in social resources, "code for everyone" can only be achieved by some people. We still need to work on it.
